        Task A.
        
        Java's strong characteristics lie in its Object-Oriented Programing, which allows for reusable
        code and modular projects. In addition, Java has a feature called automatic garbage collection, which 
        manages memory by freeing up storage for parts of the code that are not being used.

        Task B. 

        Java's biggest weakness is in its speed. Even with automatic garbage collection, Java still uses a lot 
        of memory and resources, and requires more startup time due to the use of the Java Virtual Machine on 
        every program.

        Task C.

        public class Goodbye {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println( "Good-bye!" );
                System.out.println( "See you next time." );
                
            }
        }

        Task D.

        firstChoice will not cause an error
        LastChoice will not cause an error
        _system will not cause an error
        2ndChoice will cause an error, starts with a digit
        balance$ will not cause an error
        $1 will not cause an error
        third-choice will cause an error, has an invalid character
        c1 will not cause an error
        two times will cause an error, has a whitespace
        fourth_choice will not cause an error
        true will cause an error, is a Java keyword
        done, will not cause an error


        Task E.

        int x = "hello"; ---> String x = "hello";
        String num = 79; ---> int num = 79;
        int cost = 20.86; ---> double cost = 20.86;
        boolean error = "true"; ---> boolean error = true;
        char initial = "W"; ---> char initial = 'W';
        */
